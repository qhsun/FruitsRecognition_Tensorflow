# FruitsRecognition_Tensorflow

This is a self-study project to learn the basics about Tensorflow and compare the TensorFlow performance on Local machines and Azure Databricks via Python and PySpark. 

### Data
The dataset for Fruit Recognition is obtained from [Kaggle.com] (https://www.kaggle.com/chrisfilo/fruit-recognition), which includes 44,406 fruit images in .png format. The size of this dataset is 8.49GB. Due to the restricted memory on both Azure Databricks and spec of the local machine, we build the model on 30% of the data set.
